# Introduction 

In this set of notes I would like to apply model 1 and model 2 to analyse the VAN_SPF data. 
```{r}
data <- read.csv("VAN.csv")
data <- data[-1]

# identifying all positions with NA
positions <- as.data.frame(is.na(data) + 0 ) # 1 represents NA present

# replace NA with 9999
data[is.na(data)] <- 9999
```
